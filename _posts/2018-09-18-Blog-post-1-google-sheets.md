<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What did I learn?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I didn't really learn very much in this lesson because we were introduced to a new google app that I’ve never used before. It was quite confusing and I’ve never used anything even similar to it. When we were testing it out and playing around, before we actually knew what we were doing, I didn’t know how anything worked so I didn’t really do anything productive.</td>

    <td>Next lesson I will try to be more focused on what the teacher is saying and I will ask questions to try and get a better understanding of what we need to do.</td>
